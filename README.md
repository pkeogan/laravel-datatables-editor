# laravel-datatables-editor
A intergration of Datatables Editor into Laravel.

Hello, this will be the future home of my intergration of datatables editor into laravel. This package will be updated when fully working. MY goal is to create a Service provider that will read-only the code from editor.datatables.com. This will let you be able to update the editors JS, PHP, and CSS files independly from my app, and keep there liscnes intact 

To use the editor it will look like the following.

1) Composer install this package
2) Download Datatables Editor PHP Package, and save to root of your app
3) Add a service provider
4) thats it your read to go
